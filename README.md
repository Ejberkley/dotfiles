# Brennen's Dotfiles
These are a collection of shortcuts and configuration files I use for zsh. <code>zsh</code> is very similar to <code>bash</code>, but <code>zsh</code> adds some cool features that <code>bash</code> doesn't have. Check out my [zsh formatting guide](ZSH_GUIDE.md) for more info on what some of the syntax means.

To install these files, clone the project into ~/dotfiles and the run ~/dotfiles/install. The install script will copy the contents of the dotfiles folder into your home directory. `.zshrc` will then get loaded every time you open a terminal (zsh automatically looks for a file with that name in your home directory), and that file will load the other config files.
